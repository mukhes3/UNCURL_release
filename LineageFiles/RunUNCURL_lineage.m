%     Run this function to perform lineage estimation with UNCURL. This
%     function also displays the leaf nodes of the graph with their
%     indices. The user then gets to choose which of them is the starting
%     node 
%
%Inputs: 

% M - matrix of means 
% Xconv - Matrix of convex weights
% k - no. of clusters 
%
%Outputs: 
% RedDim - Reduced dimension data 
% LinDat - Smoothed trajectories (same dimensions as RedDim) 
% AdjW - Weighted adjacency matrix for all cells 
% Adj - Adjacency matrix for the cells 
% EndNodes - List of leaf nodes of the graph
